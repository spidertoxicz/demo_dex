🔒 L2 — STRUCTURAL INTERPRETER
Mechanical Contract Freeze
Status: LOCKED
Scope: Categorical Structural Detection Only
Memory: None
Time: None
Thresholds: Forbidden
1️⃣ Identity of L2
L2 is the first intelligence layer.
It converts:
Canonical physics (L1 + L1.5)
into
Categorical structural labels.
L2 does NOT:
track lifecycle
remember past blocks
smooth signals
accumulate confidence
predict
L2 detects only what exists in the current block context.
Nothing more.
2️⃣ L2 Inputs (Strict)
L2 may read only:
CanonicalBlockFrame (via L0 → L1)
Tick-space geometry (L1.5 output)
Current block physics deltas
L2 MUST NOT read:
L3 state
L4 state
L5 state
Cursor history
Block counters
Time duration
Any rolling window
If L2 needs memory, architecture is wrong.
3️⃣ L2 Output Contract (Categorical Only)
L2 may output only fixed categorical labels.
Allowed structural flags:
Vacuum vs Wall
Salin kode

"VACUUM"
"WALL"
"NEUTRAL"
Absorption vs Retreat
Salin kode

"ABSORPTION"
"RETREAT"
"NONE"
Ahead vs Behind
Salin kode

"AHEAD"
"BEHIND"
"BALANCED"
Support Rebuild
Salin kode

"REBUILD"
"NO_REBUILD"
No other states allowed.
No numeric values allowed.
No gradients allowed.
No “weak” / “strong” modifiers allowed.
4️⃣ Prohibited Patterns in L2
Immediately forbidden:
confidence score
weight calculation
threshold tuning
minimum block count
smoothing window
rolling average
“if happens 3 times”
block duration logic
decay
time-based weakening
percentage dominance
ratio-based classification
If L2 introduces numbers, determinism conceptually weakens.
L2 must remain binary/categorical.
5️⃣ Mechanical Evaluation Rule
L2 decisions must be derived from:
Explicit physics relationships inside the current block only.
If a label cannot be explained using only:
This block’s canonical events
This block’s liquidity state
This block’s tick-space structure
Then it does not belong in L2.
6️⃣ No Lifecycle Leakage
L2 must not contain:
“anchor forming”
“range breaking”
“pressure increasing”
“structure weakening”
Those belong to L3 and L4.
L2 detects.
L3 evolves.
L4 evaluates range health.
L2 must not evolve anything.
7️⃣ Determinism Guarantee
Given identical CanonicalBlockFrame:
L2 output must be identical.
No randomness. No environment dependency. No external data.
8️⃣ Cross-Layer Protection
L2 must not:
Override L3 state
Trigger L4 transitions directly
Infer global phase
It only supplies structural flags.
FSM decides transitions.
9️⃣ Drift Prevention Rule
If future development attempts to add:
numerical tuning
probabilistic smoothing
statistical filtering
dynamic thresholds
The change must be rejected at architecture level.
L2 must remain mechanical forever.
🔐 Final Freeze Statement
L2 is a categorical structural detector.
It is:
Stateless
Threshold-free
Time-agnostic
Deterministic
Block-local
It detects. It does not remember. It does not predict. It does not grade.
FSM layers handle evolution.
L2 remains purely mechanical.
Now architecture is truly sealed.
L2 is contained. L3 is FSM. L4 is FSM. L5 is pure mapping. L6 is descriptive.
There is no soft intelligence left in the core.
Now — and only now — you are safe to move into implementation.
